## Terminology

### CRS - Coordinate Reference System

- Coordinates are just locations in arbitrary space
- CRS places those coordinates at a location on the earth
- The exact location will depend on the projection implemented by the CRS
- See [https://spatialreference.org/](https://spatialreference.org/)
- Common CRS:
   - WGS84 latitude-longitude projection, authority code "EPSG:4326"
   - UTM Zones (North): "EPSG:32633"
   - UTM Zones (South): "EPSG:32733"
   - WGS 84 / World Mercator: "EPSG:3395"
