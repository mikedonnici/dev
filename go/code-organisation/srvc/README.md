# srvc

A simple, flat service example.

The idea here is simple:

Each _entity_ (thing, model, whatever) has a file
in which it is represented by an appropriate type.

Each _entity_ also has an _entityStore_ which handles the management 
of that entity. By _handles_ I mean storage, retrieval, manipulation,
validation etc.
