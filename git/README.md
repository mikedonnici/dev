## Diffing files

- Using `diff`

```bash
$ diff file1.py file2.py 
2c2,3 <-- indicates line format and change (c)
<     return n * n
---
>     """A comment"""
>     return (n+2) * n
```

- Using `diff -u` (unified format)

```bash
 $ diff -u file1.py file2.py 
--- file1.py    2021-01-26 12:29:54.881984323 +1100
+++ file2.py    2021-01-26 12:34:41.767966975 +1100
@@ -1,2 +1,4 @@
 def foo(n):
-    return n * n
+    return (n+2) * n
+
+print("Add a new line")
```

- Other diff tools include `kdiff3`, `meld`, `vimdiff`, `wdiff`
- Create a diff file:

```bash
$ diff -u file1.py file2.py > changes.diff
```

- Apply a diff file using `patch`

```bash
$ patch file1.py < changes.diff 
patching file file1.py
```

Version Control Systems (VCS) use this approach under the hood.




## Config

```bash
$ git config --global user.email "michael@mesa.net.au"
$ git config --global user.name "Mike Donnici"
```

`.gitconfig`

```
[user]
	email = michael@mesa.net.au
	name = Mike Donnici
[core]
	editor = vim
[alias]
	last = log -1 HEAD
	ll = log --abbrev-commit --oneline --decorate --graph --all
	unstage = reset HEAD --
```

## Structure and Basic Workflow

- `.git` directory contains configuration and the complete change history of 
  all _tracked_ files
- The **working tree** contains the _current_ state of the project
- The **staging area** contains changes marked for the next _commit_   
- _Tracked_ files can be in 3 states:
   - **Modified** - the file has been changed
   - **Staged** - the change will be added to next commit 
   - **Committed** - a snapshot of the _staged_ changes has been recorded
- Basic workflow:

```bash
$ git init
$ git config -l # check identity for commits
$ git status
$ git add 
$ git commit
```

## Commit message

### Guidelines

1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
1. Capitalize the subject line
1. Do not end the subject line with a period
1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line   
1. Wrap the body at 72 characters
1. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

### Example

```
Summarize changes in around 50 characters or less

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72
characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The
blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless
you omit the body entirely).

Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you
are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that).
Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequences of this
change? Here's the place to explain them.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

 - Bullet points are okay, too

 - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded
   by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions
   vary here

If you use an issue tracker, put references to them at the bottom,
like this:

Resolves: #123
See also: #456, #789
```

## File management

### `git commit -a`

- Stage and commit tracked files in one step
- Does not `add` files

### `git log -p`

- _patch_ flag with similar output to `diff -u`

### `git show [commit id]`

- Shows the diff for the specified commit
- `git show --stat [commit id]` shows some stats

### `git diff [file]`

- Show all changes, or specific file
- Default shows only _unstaged_ changes
- `git diff --staged` shows only _staged_ changes 

### `git add -p [file]`

- Shows changes before staging

### `git mv [file] [newname]`

- Rename a tracked file
- NB: using standard shell `mv` will delete / add the file

### `git rm [file]`

- Remove files, stops file being tracked and removes from git repo

## Branching

- A branch is a pointer to a particular commit

### `git branch`

- List current branches

### `git branch [newbranch]`

- Create a new branch

### `git checkout newbranch`

- Switch to new branch

### `git checkout [newbranch]`

- Create and checkout new branch in one step

### `git branch -d [newbranch]`

- Delete branch, warns if uncommitted changes

### `git branch -D [newbranch]`

- Delete branch, ignoring uncommitted changes

## Merging branches

- Combines branch data and history
- Both branches will point to the same commit 
- Uses two different algorithms to perform a merge:
   - **Fast Forward** 
      - when no commits have occurred in the receiving branch
      - no actual _merging_ takes place, just point branches to same commit 
   - **Three-Way Merge** or `'recursive' strategy`
      - when commit(s) have occurred in divergent branches
      - attempts to _merge_ changes
      - may result in merge conflicts

### `git merge [somebranch]`

- Merges `somebranch` into current branch

### `git merge --abort`

- Abandon the current merge attempt

### `git log --graph --oneline`

- Shows nice log format to see merges

## Log

### `git log --pretty=oneline`

- Shows nice on-liner for each commit


## Tagging

- Git supports two types of tags:
  - _lightweight_ - a reference to a specific commit
  - _annotated_ - full object with name, email, message etc (generally recommended)

- ref: <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging>

### `git tag v1.2.3`

- Create a _lightweight_ tag `v1.2.3`

### `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "My message about v1.2.3"`

- Create an annotated (`-a`) tag with a message (`-m`)
- Without `-m` git launches editor (same as `commit`)

### `git tag -a v1.2.3 9fceb02`

- Tags a specific commit (in case you forget!)
- See commits with `git log --pretty=oneline` 

### `git tag -d v1.2.3`

- Delete tag locally 

### `git push origin --delete v1.2.3`

- Delete tag from remote

### `git show v1.2.3`

- Outputs tag data and the commit that was tagged

### `git tag` or `git tag -l`

- List tags
- With `-l` can match patterns, eg `git tag -l "1.8.*"`

### `git push origin v1.2.3`

- By default, git does not push tags, so push just like sharing branches
- Can do `git push --tags` to push all tags, but not recommended as can make a mess that is hard to clean up

### `git checkout v1.2.3`

- Checkout file versions tag is pointing at
