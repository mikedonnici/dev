Maths required:

- Algebra
- Statistics (Frequentist and Bayesian)
- Probability
- Linear Algebra
- Basic calculus
- Optimization

Recommended reading:

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.learndatasci.com/out/amazon-introduction-statistical-learning/) - [free](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
- [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.learndatasci.com/out/amazon-applied-predictive-modeling/)


#### R-focused path

1. [Statistics with R Specialization - Duke Uni / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics)
2. [Data Science Specialization - JHU / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

See also: [Statistics and R - Harvard / edX](https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-and-r) which is part
of a [cert program](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) - can take the courses individually.

#### Python-focused path

1. [Statistics with Python Specialization - UMich / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python)
2. [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization - UMich / Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
