    "### Concepts\n",
    "- Regular expressions, often referred to as regex, are a set of syntax components used for matching sequences of characters in strings.\n",
    "- A pattern is described as a regular expression that we've written. We say regular expression has matched if it finds the pattern exists in the string.\n",
    "- Character classes allow us to match certain classes of characters.\n",
    "- A set contains two or more characters that can match in a single character's position.\n",
    "- Quantifiers specify how many of the previous characters the pattern requires.\n",
    "- Capture groups allow us to specify one or more groups within our match that we can access separately.\n",
    "- Negative character classes are character classes that match every character except a character class.\n",
    "- An anchor matches something that isn't a character, as opposed to character classes which match specific characters.\n",
    "- A word boundary matches the space between a word character and a non-word character, or a word character and the start/end of a string\n",

    "- Common character classes: \n",
