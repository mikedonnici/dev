# GCP Security

- Two main elements:
  - Trusted cloud infrastructure
  - Encryption at rest

## Trusted cloud infrastructure - 6 layers

- Device
- Internet
- Identity
- Storage
- Deploy
- Hardware
 

## Encryption at rest
- 
- Data is uploaded and _chunked_
- Each chunk is encrypted with its own key*
- Chunks are distributed cross storage infrastructure

* 256 bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
